# Stack2D

**Stack2D** is a minimalistic Python package for constructing heterostructures from 2D materials. It provides a simple interface for stacking atomic structures, adjusting interlayer distances, and managing layer alignments using ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment).

## Features

- Stack multiple 2D materials with precise control over interlayer distances
- Simple interface built on top of ASE for compatibility with existing workflows
- Lightweight and easy to integrate

## Installation

To install the package, use pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/xpanceo-team/stack2d.git
```

## Usage

```bash
stack2d options.yaml -o heterostructure.xyx
```
